CareCompanion: AI-Powered Family Care Coordination Platform
Project Overview
CareCompanion is a web-based platform designed to help families manage the care of aging parents experiencing cognitive decline. The system serves as a "second brain" for overwhelmed caregivers, centralizing medical records, tracking daily care tasks, and using AI to surface patterns and insights that improve care quality while reducing caregiver burden.
Core Problem Statement
Caring for an aging parent with cognitive decline creates an overwhelming cognitive and emotional burden on family caregivers. They must:

Track complex medication schedules across multiple prescriptions
Coordinate care among multiple family members
Remember and communicate medical history to various healthcare providers
Monitor financial transactions for unusual activity
Maintain daily care routines while managing their own lives
Detect subtle patterns that might indicate health changes

This information is typically scattered across paper notes, text messages, calendars, and human memory - leading to missed medications, duplicated efforts, and caregiver burnout.
Target Users
Primary: Family Caregivers

Adult children caring for parents with dementia/cognitive decline
Typically managing care remotely or part-time
Often coordinating with siblings
Tech-comfortable but time-constrained
Need to reduce mental load and prevent care gaps

Secondary: Elderly Patients

Experiencing mild to moderate cognitive decline
May be capable of simple voice interactions
Value dignity and privacy
Benefit from routine and familiar interfaces
